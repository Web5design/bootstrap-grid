bootstrap-grid
==============

An angularjs bootstrap grid component.

I'm building this [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ "Twitter Bootstrap") grid component as a way to start wrapping my head around angular directives, and directive specific testing using Jasmine & Testacular. I based this project off a [great demo project by Vojta Jina](https://github.com/vojtajina/ng-directive-testing "ng-directive-testing").
