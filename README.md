bootstrap-grid
==============

An AngularJS/Bootstrap grid component.

I'm building this [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ "Twitter Bootstrap") grid component as a way to start wrapping my head around [AngularJS directives](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive "AngularJS directives"), and directive specific testing using [Testacular](http://vojtajina.github.com/testacular/ "Testacular") and [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ "Jasmine"). 

I based this project off a [great demo project by Vojta Jina](https://github.com/vojtajina/ng-directive-testing "ng-directive-testing"). Here's a [video ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB5b67Cg6bc "Testing Directives") of Vojta going through that directive testing workflow.
