bootstrap-grid
==============
This is data-driven bootstrap grid component that I made as a toy project while learning about angular directives and testing.

I used this project by Vojta Jina as a starting point:
[ng-directive-testing](https://github.com/vojtajina/ng-directive-testing "ng-directive-testing")
