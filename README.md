bootstrap-grid
==============
This is a toy project to help me learn about angular directives and get an initial feel for testing.

Description of what the component actually does and why goes here (aka.. will never be written)

I used this project by Vojta Jina as a starting point:
[ng-directive-testing](https://github.com/vojtajina/ng-directive-testing "ng-directive-testing")
