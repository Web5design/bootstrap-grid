bootstrap-grid
==============

An AngularJS/Bootstrap grid component.

I'm building this [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ "Twitter Bootstrap") grid component as a way to start wrapping my head around [AngularJS directives](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive "AngularJS directives"), and directive specific testing using Jasmine & Testacular. I based this project off a [great demo project by Vojta Jina](https://github.com/vojtajina/ng-directive-testing "ng-directive-testing"). Here's a [good video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB5b67Cg6bc "Testing Directives") with Vojta explaining his process of directive testing. While you're at it, check out [Testacular](http://vojtajina.github.com/testacular/ "Testacular"), and [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ "Jasmine"). 

Whew! Nuff stuff to learn much??
