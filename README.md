bootstrap-grid
==============
This is data-driven bootstrap grid that I'm making to help me learn about angular directives and get an initial feel for testing code in general. 

I used this project by Vojta Jina as a starting point:
[ng-directive-testing](https://github.com/vojtajina/ng-directive-testing "ng-directive-testing")
