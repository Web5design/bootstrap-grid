bootstrap-grid
==============
This is data-driven bootstrap grid component that in an attempt to learn about angular directives and also to get an initial feel for testing (something I've been putting off for too long) 

I used this project by Vojta Jina as a starting point:
[ng-directive-testing](https://github.com/vojtajina/ng-directive-testing "ng-directive-testing")
